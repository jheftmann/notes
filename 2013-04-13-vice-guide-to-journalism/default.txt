> “My big thing was I want you to do stupid in a smart way and smart in a stupid way. So if you’re going to Palestine, try to find a good burger joint. Don’t talk about Israel and the borders, 1967, Gaza—just find a good burger joint. Conversely, if you’re gonna do a thing on farts or poo, talk to experts in digestion, find out the history of what we know about farts, why they smell. Be super-scientific and get all the data.“

-Gavin McInnes
