Tonight I walked down a block in Brooklyn I'm not often on. Not because it's out of the way or because I'm never in the neighborhood. It's just not really on my way anywhere, typically.

I guess I noted my location because the last time I was there must've been the week I moved to New York, which is now four years ago. It was one of those silent, snowy nights. I turned the wrong way trying to find the apartment I was moving into, which I had only been to once when I was meeting the other roommates. It was behind — and sort of under — a bar.

It's only tonight that I realized I was only one block from where I was going, and just on the other side of Bedford Avenue.  Yet at the time, I remember feeling like I was very far from everything.

Margin_notes:
- Being under a bar as it was, part of the apartment had very low ceilings. Low enough that once, having cut my finger, I jumped in pain only to hit my head on the ceiling. (I do not jump high.)
