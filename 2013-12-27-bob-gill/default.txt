> “When I met Fletcher and Forbes, it was obvious that we should form a partnership. So Fletcher, Forbes & Gill was formed right in the middle of the swinging '60s. As Fletcher would say, it was like shooting fish in a barrel because instantly we were the most important design office not only in England, but in Europe. It was absolutely incredible, but it started getting bigger and bigger. I decided it wasn't for me, the size of it. They changed the name to Pentagram."

>“There was a kid there [in the agency] doing paste-up. He must have been 16 or 17. He was a drummer. And I used to be a jazz pianist. There was occasionally a Christmas party or something, and I would say: 'Charlie, come on. Bring a drum and we'll entertain the people'. So we played together. I used to say to him: 'Charlie, you're not a very good designer. I know that's your dream to be a great designer, but I don't think you're going to make it. But I think you're a terrific drummer'. So one day he came to me and he said 'I'm going to take your advice. I am quitting and I just joined a band'. 'That's wonderful, Charlie'. He said 'Nah, you're not going to like it'. 'What's the matter?' Because we both loved jazz. He said 'It's not a jazz band. It's a rock band'. I said 'Oh Charlie, why are you going such a dopey thing?' He said 'Well, I don't know.' Anyway, out was The Rolling Stones. That shows you what I know."
