I've had the pleasure of working with talented photographer Alastair Casey on [his new website](http://www.alastaircasey.com). His photos are terrific and it should work on all your devices, so have a visit.

I think I almost enjoy the mobile and tablet versions more than the desktop one!

Footnotes:
1. This was my second experience using [Flywheel](http://www.getflywheel.com) for Wordpress hosting. It's a great service and have no hesitation recommending it for client projects built on WordPress. They take care of set-up, there's no mucking around in a complicated admin area with tons of options clients don't need, and their support is __excellent__. The best feature, though, is that the site is online behind a password during development so you can review with clients. When you're ready to go live, you can turn the billing over to your client while keeping admin access.
