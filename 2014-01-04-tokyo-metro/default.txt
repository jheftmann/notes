In Japan, design is practiced in such a way as to make American efforts look like pure dilettantism. We give things gimmicky names like Design Thinking and Experience Design, whereas in Japan, after spending any time at all there, you get the impression that it’s simply How Things Are Done.

That’s all beside the point I want to make here, though, so instead of getting bogged down in a long and not-very-fun article arguing that point, I would urge you to just go there and see for yourself.

Instead, let’s look specifically at a few smart things about the Tokyo Metro<sup class=footnoted>1</sup>:

1. **Metro cards** — There are single-ride tickets which are disposable<sup class= footnoted>2</sup>, but the re-fillable cards, called *Passmo*, are magical: they’re sturdy, there’s no magnetic strip to wear out, they’re asymmetrical so you know which way they go in the top-up machine, and they use some proximity-based technology so you don’t need to take it out of your wallet or swipe it in any specific way to use it<sup class= footnoted>3</sup>. Bonus: they look great.

2.  **Traffic guidance** — I’ve had a weird dream since I moved to New York: I’ve wanted to do an experiment<sup class= footnoted>4</sup> that would measure whether marking traffic patterns on subway station floors changes behavior. Could we reduce that free-for-all disaster that happens in that awkward middle area at Union Square? Or the tendency of people to walk on the inside of blind turns regardless of the direction they’re going?

The Tokyo Metro has traffic arrows, divider lines, markings for car doors, written prompts, etc. I even noticed at a few stations a physically divided entrance to stairways, sort of like an on-ramp to prevent that thing that happens when a train lets out and everyone is coming up the stairs and you’re trying to make it onto said train.

Then again, basically every other country is good at standing on the side of escalators without any prompting.

4. **In-carriage signage** — Displays tell you what car you’re in and show it in relation to the station’s platform. Exits and services are also marked so you don’t have to pretend to be looking at something when you start walking toward the end of the platform with no exit<sup class=footnoted>5</sup>.

5. **Numbered stops** — All stops are marked with the abbreviation of the line and the number of the stop.

6. **Numbered exits** — Station exits are numbered. It’s easy to rendervous with people, and businesses/points of interest often note the best exit to use.

7. **Time between stops** — Route maps show travel-time between stops. Of course this also requires trains to run punctually.

Of course there are also things like the fact that the trains are quiet, clean, and run on-time that I’ve left of this list because they can’t be accomplished through mandate alone.

#### One thing I’m not a fan of
One thing<sup class= footnoted>6</sup> that doesn’t seem great are distance-based fares. Public transportation is a great equalizer; charging people that live farther from the city center can effectively be a regressive tax<sup class= footnoted>7</sup>. It’s also more confusing, even if with the super-easy Passmo you don’t really have to think about it.

Footnotes:
1. This is not meant as a prescription nor comparison for the New York subway system, though a bit of comparison is inevitable. I’m a huge advocate of our system and it would be presumptuous to think that you could transplant these lessons easily or effectively.
2. I guess NYC subway tickets could conceivably be single-ride and disposable as well – good job then, MTA, for adding the new-card surcharge
3. I joke that MTA cards are designed specifically to expose tourists because of the just-so touchiness of the swipe
4. Or at least a blog-post thought experiment; maybe I’ll have the motivation now
5. Maybe I’m vain and only I do that
6. Actually, there’s a second: trains don’t run 24-hours
7. Disclaimer: I’m not an economist nor an expert in the socioeconomic demographics of Tokyo
