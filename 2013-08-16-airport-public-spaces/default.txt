I think often of the story I heard about a lazy (the storyteller's words, for emphasis I'm sure, not mine) architect(1): when she designed a campus dorm complex, she intentionally left the common spaces and connecting pathways undesigned. After construction was complete and the first winter came, she recorded the foot-paths made in the snow by the complex's inhabitants. She designed the paths, intersections, and gathering points in the same places.

When I was in Berlin in July, I arrived at Sch√∂nfeld airport on a pleasant summer day. There's a large lawn between the train station and the terminal entrance, and on it, travelers were napping, picnicking, and rendezvous-ing.

Inside, it's quite an uncomfortable airport with its shoddy furniture, cold floors, low ceilings, and lack of concessions. Even newer terminals don't really have the kind of relaxed, pleasant space you see above for people to wait for flights. And let's face it: a lot of flying is waiting.

It made my wonder why this kind of space (indoor or out) didn't exist _within_ the airport.

Of course, space is always at a premium, especially when it must be confined within the controlled security-area of an airport. Berlin winters are quite harsh, and airports in similar climates might have a hard time dedicating area to spaces that won't be used year-round. I did notice, however, that the new terminal in Barcelona had a nice central courtyard somewhat similar to what I'm describing above (I feel like this is a new addition since I lived there, even more recent than the terminal itself, but I could be wrong). Their winters are warmer than Berlin's, to be sure, but still cold enough that the space risks going unused for a part of the year.

And though I'm not by any stretch one to promote smoking, smokers deserve their dignity just as much as the rest of us.
