> â€œThere's nothing in my head that's original, and I'll wager that there's nothing original in yours either. Why? Because our heads are full of junk that's put there by the culture. The only way to clear out the junk is to have an opinion - and if it's an interesting opinion, then the design [that it informs] will be interesting.

> If you want your lives and your work to be interesting, don't just do layouts - but think about the brief and come up with an opinion that will inform your design approach. If you're designing a logo for a dry cleaners, don't sit at your computer, go to a dry cleaners!"
