Small Victories takes the contents of a Dropbox folder (or folders) and turns it into a website. Those folders live in your Dropbox in a folder called **Apps** (Dropbox makes it automatically for connected apps). Each of those folders corresponds with a website (a Small Victory, if you will).

You can just drop *things* (images, text, videos, HTML snippets, website bookmarks) into a folder and have them render on the web. Here’s what one of my site folders looks like:

And here’s the website it makes, using the [Slideshow theme]():

There’s no CMS, uploading, publishing, servers, databases, code, or additional software required. If you have a Dropbox account (or want to make a free one), all you need is the Finder on your computer.

[Sign up](http://www.smallvictori.es) and we’ll send you a link in the coming days to get started. By the way, the sign-up page is built on Small Victories (of course).

### Other features
You can write your own JavaScript and CSS, connect a custom domain, and do all that good stuff. We’ll provide some guidance when we start letting people make sites.

## How is it different from a CMS, Dropbox-based or otherwise?
Setting up, installing, building, uploading, publishing, coding, hosting, CMSes, logging in – those are all things I didn’t want to deal with when I imagined this product.

For some types of websites that process makes sense. But there are a lot of websites that: (1) you want to quickly get online to share with people; (2) fit nicely into a common pattern (“I need an email sign-up page”).

I wanted to be able to make lots of websites quickly. Not precious websites, big websites, or client websites; just useful websites that I could share with people immediately.

### Some opinions I have about managing, publishing, and hosting content
- A lot of websites follow familiar patterns that don’t need to be made from scratch, last forever, or be heavily customized.
- A lot of easy or quick website replacements are very prescriptive about how they look (Dropbox Carousel), or very hard to customize (Tumblr).
- To me, a CMS like Squarespace is the worst of everything: too confusing for beginners and too restrictive for experts.
- Flat-file CMSes are great but a bit complicated for one-page sites, or for your mother.

## V1: lessons learned
Small Victories v1 launched in the summer of 2013. Outside of just not being able to invest more time in it, I made some mistakes the first time around and desperately wanted another go at what I still think is a great product:

1. Even though the platform was extremely flexible, it wasn’t immediately apparent to new users. I did a bad job of showing what it could do. Most users were limited by their imaginations but I also did them no favors. This time around, we’re releasing themes with demos to give you an idea of what you can build with SV:

	- [Feed](http://demo-feed.smvi.co) — A moodboard-style theme for showing images, websites (drag a .webloc file into your site folder), and text snippets
	- [Slideshow](http://demo-slideshow.smvi.co) — Turn photos into an image grid and slideshow
	- [Campaign](http://demo-campaign.smvi.co) — Add Mailchimp info to create a newsletter sign-up page
	- [Homepage](http://demo-homepage.smvi.co) — Quick personal homepage
	- [Document](http://demo-document.smvi.co) — Turns a text file into a nicely formatted document, and if there are multiple text files it will let you switch between them.
	- [Presentation](http://demo-presentation.smvi.co) — Turn a bulleted list into a series of slides (text or images)

2. V1 supported custom CSS and JavaScript but we didn’t have any in-use examples when the product launched. Nobody realized how much customizing you could do. See in-use examples:

	- Feed theme: [Salon des Refuses](http://www.salondesrefus.es)
	- Feed theme: [vis:dmcg](http://vis.dmcg.co)
	- [Campaign theme](): [sign-up/temporary homepage](http://www.smallvictori.es)

3. I didn’t do a good job of explaining the how and why of the product on the homepage, so we’re going to release a more robust ‘marketing site’ when we’re ready for the public launch.

4. I stuck to my guns too much. I wanted *everything* to be done in the Finder, but I realize now that as used to using the Finder as people are, they’re also used to *signing in* to a web service to do some level of account management. So now, some of the settings-type stuff you need to do can be done either through the finder or through a web interface.

5. Having time and a [smart, committed team](http://xxix.co) dedicated to supporting and improving the product.

## What’s next
We’ll slowly be sending out links to sign up, which isn’t some kind of cheesy marketing maneuver but just us making sure this thing works.

We also have a lot of themes and features on the roadmap for the near future.
