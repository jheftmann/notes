> &ldquo;I grew up at 365 South 3rd Street in Williamsburg. I remember doing my homework â€“ it was to write down as many signers of the Declaration of Independence as you know. I knew three. My brother Irving came home, and I said, &lsquo;Irving, I only have three. I&rsquo;m going to fail this test.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;Where do you play ball?&rsquo; &lsquo;I play ball on Franklin Avenue.&rsquo; He says, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s one.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;Where do you play roller hockey?&rsquo; &lsquo;On Hooper.&rsquo; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s another.&rsquo; &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the library?&rsquo; &lsquo;Hewes.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, there&rsquo;s another one.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;Wait a minute, I&rsquo;m beginning to get it.&rsquo; I aced that test&rdquo;
