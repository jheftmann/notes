##### The problem

Everyone gets a lot of emails. On a loose team, [especially one that’s sometimes spread across multiple locations](http://www.at-elier.org), it's difficult to make sure that everyone has visibility into those communications while keeping the number of emails to a minimum. If we were three people and had this issue, we assumed it could only get worse the bigger a team got.

##### An idea

We started using Slack a couple of months back and it’s mostly worked really well for us in cutting down on internal emails. We thought there might also be a way to bend Slack to help with external emails too.

##### Reaching towards a solution

Allow me to introduce [Franke](http://www.getfranke.com):

Franke works in a couple ways:

1. When you sign up for Franke using your Slack account, we make you some custom email addresses. You can send / forward / CC or BCC Franke, and he'll sort these emails into corresponding channels.<sup class= footnoted>1</sup>
2. You can also set up some rules for Franke to follow:
	- Let's say you have an email address for new business leads. Franke can take anything sent to **sales@yourteam.com** and he’ll put it in the channel you tell him to.
	- You can also have all emails from a certain URL sorted into a channel. You might want all the emails related to a project in one place, so anything from **@client.com** can go to **#client**

We left a lot of room in how Franke works; we think your team will find some clever ways to use it.

##### Don't care?

At least go see the flying emojis.

1. Franke also looks at who sends the email so you can control who can post this way.
